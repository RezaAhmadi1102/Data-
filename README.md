4.1.	The ùú∫-constraint method for deterministic data

‚Ä¢	One vendor, one retailer, and one period

Firstly, a small-sized instance is described and solved using the proposed mathematical model to ensure the accuracy performance of the proposed model. Characteristics of the small numerical instance consisting of one vendor and one retailer under infinite or unauthorized backorder conditions (i.e. P-V1R1T1) are presented in Table 2.

‚Ä¢	One vendor, three retailers, and three periods

This section extends the numerical example to one vendor, three retailers, and three periods (P-V1R3T3) to evaluate solutions under complex conditions.


4.2.	Investigating the impact of uncertainty using decision tree

To study the impact of uncertainty, different scenarios are considered for each product as follows:

ÔÉò	Change in initial price of goods and manufacturing cost per unit of goods.

ÔÉò	Changes in the value of transition probabilities

ÔÉò	Changes in the value of the rate of return
